================

Pulse Audio Volume Control Applet for Lxpanel and other common Linux Desktop panels.
This applet will allow you to simply turn up/down the pulseaudio volume.

This applet is incomplete, but basic functionality works. I am posting it for anyone
who may wish to improve it. Written in Python. All patches are welcome. Original code by Mitchell Nemitz.


Bugs/Issues-
There is some bug with using Mute.
Audio Settings and Preferences have not been implemented.
